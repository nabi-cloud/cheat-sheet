# Cheat Sheet Project: My Web Development Reference Guide
Reference to HTML and CSS tags and properties.


## Project Goals
In this project, I embarked on the exciting journey of web development, creating my personal reference cheat sheet to help me build websites more efficiently in the future!


## Prerequisites
To get started on this project, I completed the following courses:

- Introduction to HTML: Including the HTML tables lesson.
- Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules.


## Project Overview
I had the freedom to select any HTML or CSS topic that I had learned up until now. The project's aim was to compile valuable information and insights into a concise yet comprehensive reference sheet. Some potential topics I considered were:

HTML Tables: Mastering the art of structuring data with HTML tables.
Exploring Other HTML Tags: An in-depth look at various HTML tags and their functionalities.
CSS Selectors and Specificity: Understanding the power of CSS selectors and how specificity affects styling.
Common CSS Properties: A compilation of frequently used CSS properties to enhance the appearance of web pages.


## Implementation
In developing my cheat sheet, I chose to organize the information using HTML tables. By labeling the columns in the HTML, I ensured clarity and ease of comprehension for future reference.

To give the cheat sheet a touch of personalization, I incorporated a custom color scheme, leveraging the named CSS colors to craft a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

One of the key features I implemented was custom styling for code snippets. To enhance readability, I used a monospace font family to represent code elements, such as HTML tags ```h1```, and employed a distinct background color to make them stand out.


## Reflections
Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of HTML and CSS concepts. Creating a reference guide from scratch allowed me to internalize the information and reinforced my knowledge.
