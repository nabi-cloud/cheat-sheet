## Project Goals
In this project, I embarked on the exciting journey of web development, creating my personal reference cheat sheet to help me build websites more efficiently in the future!

<br>

## Prerequisites
To get started on this project, I completed the following courses:

- Introduction to HTML: Including the HTML tables lesson.
- Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules.

<br>

## Project Overview
I had the freedom to select any HTML or CSS topic that I had learned. The project's aim was to compile valuable information and insights into a concise reference website. Some potential topics I considered were:

HTML Tables: Mastering the art of structuring data with HTML tables.
Exploring Other HTML Tags: An in-depth look at various HTML tags and their functionalities.
CSS Selectors and Specificity: Understanding the power of CSS selectors and how specificity affects styling.
Common CSS Properties: A compilation of frequently used CSS properties to enhance the appearance of web pages.

<br>

## Implementation
In developing my cheat sheet, I chose to organize the information using HTML tables. Labeling the columns in the HTML ensures clarity and ease of comprehension for future reference.

I also incorporated a custom color scheme, leveraging the named CSS colors to craft a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

One of the key features implemented here was custom styling for code snippets. To enhance readability, I used a monospace font family to represent code elements, such as HTML tags ```h1```, and employed a distinct background color to make them stand out.

## Reflections
Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of HTML and CSS concepts. Creating a reference guide from scratch allowed me to internalize the information and reinforced my knowledge.
